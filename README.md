# Lunar Navigator Robot using Particle Filters

## Implementation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98e486a3-aedd-4981-9328-aafa53b98a43






A simulation of autonomous robot navigation on lunar terrain using particle filter localization. The simulation detects craters as obstacles from actual lunar surface imagery and demonstrates path planning with obstacle avoidance.
Features
Real-time crater detection from lunar surface images using computer vision
Particle filter-based robot localization
Dynamic obstacle avoidance
Waypoint-based navigation
Trajectory visualization
Video recording of simulation
